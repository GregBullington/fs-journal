# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


What a week. There was alot to do and alot that got done. It is nice to be able to partner program. 
The project we worked on got completed and was in a really good state. Unfortunately I still struggle a bit on the logic side of thing. 
such as making the server or writing alot of the functionality without using reference. in due time I hope.
