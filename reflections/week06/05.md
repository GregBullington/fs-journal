# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Been a heck of a week.. have had some challenges but my biggest one has to be just understanding things. maybe i shouldnt try but it would be nice to be able to say why something does what it does or why it goes in that area. Im sure ill pick it up more as things go on. just have to continue to learn and keep using my resources.
