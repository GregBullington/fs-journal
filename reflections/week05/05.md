# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

For the most part things went pretty well this week. Not to many hard to learn concepts. Now with that said I may not be the profficient in getting things built out from scratch but I can explain how everything works for the most part. I have discovered I enjoy the styling and design aspect so far the most. As I understand the backend and client code more I may start enjoying that more also . I enjoy the creativity I can have with designing pages. So far im still having a good time.
