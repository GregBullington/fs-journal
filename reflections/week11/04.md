Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It seems like it has been the shortest time frame through this course. I cant believe we are already at the end. Its finals time though so focus and direction are important here to making sure there is plenty of time to complete the project I will manage whats being done through goal setting. I will complete different phases of the project within specific days to make sure I am on track and successfully completing the project.
