  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

    //   SELECT
    //   p.*,
    //   d.*
    //   FROM patients p
    //   JOIN doctors d ON p.id = d.patientId
    //   WHERE p.id = @id;
