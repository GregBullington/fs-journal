## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope describes where a variable can be used. ie. globally function etc.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a mechanism used by javascript to move variables and function declarations to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

generally you want to use let as the normal unless you dont want avaiable to change, then you use const. 
Conts cannot be changed once declared. Var can be used when you want a variable to be globally scoped and want it to be able to be changed later.
