Oh boy, this one was a little tough for me. I have been having a little bit of a hard time figuring out where to start. I think i understand a little bit better how to set up functions to do what i want them to, but i still struggle with the getting started part. Im sure as i go along and use these things more i will get it. Just is a little frustrating that i have a good amount of knowledge but cant put the bits of it together to click. Doing the web game has helped a little bit. On the bright side i can always look up specific ways to do things. I was able to successfully complete the web game and get alot of functionality into it the way that made sense to me. As time goes on i will just pick up on the better ways to do it and in a way that is will be cleaner in terms of the coding.
