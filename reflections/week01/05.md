# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Alright, so at this point in the course im feeling a little bit uneasy when it comes to understanding concepts, but I assume that will subside with time. I was a little surprised to see the process that you would want to take when thinking about design. Wireframing was certainly a little surprise, although it makes total sense. Struggle is a part of the process I suppose. Getting a grip on the concept of page structure with bootstrap has definitely been a struggle. I have been able to get a really solid understanding of css and also utilizing classes in html. My biggest struggle would probably have to be with columns. I havent quite figured out entirely how to use them yet. 

I do feel like I will catch on though the more I put things to use. 

Absolutely I was catching on a bit more while doing the site clone and things are starting to make more sense already.
