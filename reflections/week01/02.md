## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo classes are used as a way to change the state of an element.
Examples such as img:hover <-- hover being the pseudo allows us to change the img if the user hovers their mouse over the img. Other Pseudos include :first-child, :last-child, :focus, etc. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity, measured in hundreds, tens, and ones. Whichever CSS rule has the higher number, in the event that mutiple rules target the same element and property, is the rule applied.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The overuse of !important can create conflict or self inflicted bugs when you try to set specific alternate rules or declarations in styling. Especially when working with other devs.
