## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

wireframing give a well thought out theoretical design to a site or mobile app. 
It allows to give a good idea of what a site can look like before you build it out, so you dont have to go backwards. You can get a clear idea of what the site will look like and easily make changes before it is complete. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes are your typical 3 types. Low fidelity is a good conversation starter and can get ideas flowing, rough draft. Mid fidelity is generally the most common as it gives a more accurate representation of the lay out without really being distracting with images and typography. 
High fidelity is a close representation of what the final product will look like with more design elements shown such as images and relevant text, more specific.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

My thoughts would be absolutely! You would go build a house without a set of blueprints first. Wireframes give you the blueptint to your site before commtting to a trial and error approach of designing anything. in reality it pobably saves time as its a lot easier to undo a mistake or redesign something before its been commited to. You wouldnt want to get near completion on a building and realize that you have to dismantle it completely because you forgot build space for a stair set inside...
