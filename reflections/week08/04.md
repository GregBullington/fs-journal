## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing: provides testing of individual testing of code by itself instilling confidence in your code
Component testing: provides testing of whole components mounted to the dom asserting working condition with testing based more like the software and its realistic use.
E2E testing: Holistic testing providing more showing what will happen when the application is in full use by a user.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Based on what I understand I would say that unit testing is the most useful as it lets you test individual layers before they get integrated as whole, providing confidence and also allowing for a lesser impact on the whole application in the event something fails.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I would have to say that all methods of testing are useful in their own respective way.
