Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Ah, what a week it has been. I have had a lot of fun with our latest application. It has had its frustrating times but I do find even those to still be fun. Progress has moved along very nicely and I believe the team will be close to working on mainly stretch goals and styling with quite a lot of time left. A couple of times there was some pretty app breaking bugs but we were able to get those worked out nicely though we did lose some time on them. Once the bugs got cleared up though progress was back on track.
