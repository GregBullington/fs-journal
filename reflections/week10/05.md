# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

there was alot to learn this week and in an even shorter period of time i am confident that I could with references but I havent grasped full understanding of C# and SQL yet. There is much practice to do over the break though and hopefully things will become more clear.
