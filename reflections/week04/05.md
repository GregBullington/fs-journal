# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This one was bit of a ride but overall feeling a little more confident was able to successfully complete tasks using the concepts that we have been learning. I was able to overcome some stuff like getting  a little better grasp on the MVC pattern. I was able to solve some issue with code with little help. I am looking forward to getting more into other frameworks and expanding my knowledge. I struggle still a bit on getting started witht things but I do feel my understanding is getting better. We shall see further as we progress.
